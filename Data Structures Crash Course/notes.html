    <h1>Data Structures Crash Course Notes</h1>

    <h3>Memory</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All memory in a system is limited, where you cannot add more memory if you run out. Use and free memory wisely!</li>
        <li>Every variable takes up a memory slot</li>
        <li>Memory is represented by bits</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Every 8 bits is 1 byte</li>
                <li>An integer that is 32-bit takes up 1 slot, while a 64-bit integer takes up 2 slots</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Endianness refers to the order of bytes, big or small endian does not matter as long as it is consistent</li>
        <li>Strings are stored in memory as ASCII codes, to keep each letter/symbol binary</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Binary numbers are just the 1s and 0s that the computer can read, it starts with the base of 2 to the power of 1.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pointers just <em>point</em> to a memory address to access the data without having to "re-store" it in the memory</li>
    </ul>
    <span></span>

    <h3>Logarithm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Although log(n) time may be daunting at first, it can be compared to the <em>opposite</em> of a power of 2 that tips in your favor</li>
        <li>Log(n) time happens when an algorithm <em>cuts</em> the input in half every time it runs</li>
        <li>It can also be rewritten as log(4) = 2  or 2<sup>2</sup> = 4</li>
    </ul>
